<h1>莎士比亚的十四行诗</h1>
<br/>
<p>From fairest creatures we desire increase</p>
<br/>
<p>That thereby beauty's rose might never die</p>
<br/>
<p>But as the riper should by time decease</p>
<br/>
<p>His tender heir might bear his memory:</p>
<br/>
<p>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes</p>
<br/>
<p>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel</p>
<br/>
<p>Making a famine where abundance lies</p>
<br/>
<p>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</p>
<br/>
<p>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament</p>
<br/>
<p>And only herald to the gaudy spring</p>
<br/>
<p>Within thine own bud buriest thy content</p>
<br/>
<p>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</p>
<br/>
<p>Pity the world, or else this glutton be</p>
<br/>
<p>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</p>
